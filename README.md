## FizzBuzz done TDD with micro commits
I guess there's no point in looking at the project result you see here.  
All the interesting stuff is in the commit logs:)

#### Disclaimer:
This was my first attempt to do micro commits, so I chose a problem I know well.
In that regard, it may look "too clean" to be intersting.
